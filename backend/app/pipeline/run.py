"""Pipeline entry point — chains classify → identify → extract → retrieve → ground → verify → act → refer.

``run_decode_stream`` is the source of truth: a generator that yields a progress
event after each stage so the frontend can show what the AI is doing, then a
terminal event carrying the full ``DecodeResponse``. ``run_decode`` simply drains
that generator and returns the final response, so the two can never drift apart.
